## About

> This set of tools was made to simplify and automate some daily tasks of linux administrators. It includes **logtail** for extraction relevant information from ***/var/log/syslog***, 
> **stripconf** to get info on only active settings from ***.conf*** files, **hist-filter** for those who hate pressing ***Ctrl-R*** multiple times while looking for particular command in ***history***,
> **hist-switch** to turn bash history ***on/off***
> If you have any ideas about what to add to this set, feel free to create an issue or a pull request

### Built With

> Pure bash and bash only. No strings attached. Thus it can be installed to any debian-based liux distro and any architecture

## Getting Started

### Installation

> `git clone https://github.com/sureserverman/adminitools.git`\
> `dpkg-deb --build adminitools`\
> `sudo dpkg -i adminitools`


## Usage

> `logtail -h` or `logtail --help` - to print help\
> `logtail` without arguments to print help again\
> `logtail argument1 argument2...` with as many arguments as you need\
> where argument should be substring that you want to find from your log\
> The output is last 50 lines from log, which contain *argument1* substring, then\
> after key pressed by the user, last 50 lines from log, which contain *argument2* substring etc.
> 
> `stripconf -h` or `stripconf --help` - to print help\
> `stripconf` without arguments to print help again\
> `stripconf argument1 argument2...` with as many arguments as you need\
> where argument should be name of the file, which contains configuration information
> 
> `hist-filter -h` or `hist-filter --help` - to print help\
> `hist-filter` without arguments to print help again\
> `hist-filter argument1 argument2...` with as many arguments as you need\
> The output will be last 50 commands from bash history, that contain *argument1*\
> Then it waits for any key to be pressed by you and prints out last 50 commands, that contain *argument2* etc
> 
> `histswitch -h` or `histswitch --help` - to print help
> `histswitch` without arguments to enable history when disabled and disable when enabled
> `histswitch yes` to enable history
> and `histswitch no` to disable history
> The settings are stored in /etc/hist/enable file
